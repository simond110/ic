= DEV ENV

A few helper commands that form the "dshell".

All commands are living in link:./commands[./commands]. A command `cmd_name`
lives in a file `./commands/<cmd_name>`. The file should contain the following:

[source,bash]
....

# @@ Command header, single line.
#
# @ A description of the command, potentially spanning multiple lines. This
# @ includes the usage.


# The actual command

echo "Hello!"
....

All commands in `./commands` will be loaded by when sourcing `./load`. The
header will be listed in `dhelp`. The description will be shown with both
`<cmd_name> --help` and `dhelp <cmd_name>`.
